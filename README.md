# Dice-Kingdom-Game
This is a fun and interactive dice game that I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple game where two players take turns rolling a dice, aiming to be the first to reach a score of 100.

**Game Features**

1.Roll Dice: Players take turns rolling the dice to collect points.

2.Hold Score: Players can choose to hold their score, adding the points from their current turn to their total score.

3.Switch Player: If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and it's the next player's turn.

4.Winning Condition: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

5.Reset Game: Players can reset the game at any time, starting over with all scores set to zero.
